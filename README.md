## The REIT Prophets ##

With this project we wanted to explore Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).

We used python's class function to try and more efficiently iterate and locate data via tickers using yahoo finance's API as a datasource.
Using Prophet to create predictive models for the 10 REITs we chose, both from 2009 and 2017.
Using the Darts library, we created an additional linear regression model.
Also, we used HvPlot to make visualizations for our models and predictions.

## LexBot
We formatted a AWS LexBot to help facilitate passing along information to the end-user.  It understands the list of the top 10 REITs, their tickers, and their industry type.

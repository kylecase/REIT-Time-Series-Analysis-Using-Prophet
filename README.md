## The REIT Prophets ##

With this project we wanted to explore Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
Moreover we wanted to look into a predictive forecast model for them using Prophet.  We also built out a LexBot facilitate passing along information to the end-user.  
Specifically, we used python's class function to try and more efficiently iterate and locate tickers using yahoo finance as a datasource.
We also used HvPlot to make visualizations for our models and predictions.
